On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\n","\n","One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n","\n","In 1997, the story of the Titanic was brought to the big screen and it allowed us to relive the story of two passengers, Jack and Rose, members of  different social classes, who fall in love on the ill-fated passenger liner.\n","\n","How many of you have seen the movie Titanic?   \n","\n","Most of you probably were not born when the movie came out, so in case you have not seen it yet, I’m not going to spoil it. In this lab we are going to work with a Titanic dataset to determine what sort of people were likely to survive the disaster. In particular we would like to predict if Jack and Rose would have survived. Afterwards, those of you who have not seen the movie can go and watch it to see if our predictions match the Hollywood story."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"LU4cjlHeGv-a","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Define the Problem\n","Our objective is to predict whether or not Jack and Rose would have survived the Titanic tragedy, based on what we know about them from the movie Titanic directed by James Cameron. \n","\n","From the movie we can assume the following about Jack and Rose:\n","\n","* Jack: 3rd class, no siblings, male, 25 years old, no cabin, fare = 7, embarked from Southhampton  \n","* Rose: 1st class, no siblings, has spouse, 22 years old, cabin, fare = 50,  embarked from Southhampton\n","\n","To achieve this objective we are provided with historical data obtained after the Titanic tragedy.

You should watch the movie to find out if the prediction is correct.\n","\n","### Discussion\n","Given that the accuracy for all of our models is maxing out around 80%, it will be interesting to look at specific passengers for whom these prediction algorithms are incorrect. Provided is a list of some of the passengers that were incorrectly predicted: \n","\n","#### Allison family\n","For instance, three incorrectly classified passengers are members of the Allison family, who perished even though the model predicted that they would survive. These first class passengers were very wealthy, as can be evidenced by their far-above-average ticket prices. For Betsy (25) and Loraine (2) in particular, not surviving is very surprising, considering that we found earlier that over 96% of first class women lived through the disaster.  \n","\n","So what happened? A surprising amount of information on each Titanic passenger is available online; it turns out that the Allison family was unable to find their youngest son Trevor and was unwilling to evacuate the ship without him. Tragically, Trevor was already safe in a lifeboat with his nurse and was the only member of the Allison family to survive the sinking.\n","\n","#### John Jacob Astor\n","Another interesting example is John Jacob Astor, who perished in the disaster even though the model predicted he would survive. Astor was the wealthiest person on the Titanic, an impressive feat on a ship full of multimillionaire industrialists, railroad tycoons, and aristocrats. Given his immense wealth and influence, which the model may have deduced from his ticket fare (valued at over \\$35,000 in 2016 dollars), it seems likely that he would have been among the 35 percent of men in first class to survive. However, this was not the case: although his pregnant wife survived, John Jacob Astor’s body was recovered a week later, along with a gold watch, a diamond ring with three stones, and no less than \\$92,481 (2016 value) in cash.\n","\n","On the other end of the spectrum is Olaus Jorgensen Abelseth, a 25-year-old Norwegian sailor. Abelseth, as a man in 3rd class, was not expected to survive by our classifier. Once the ship sank, however, he was able to stay alive by swimming for 20 minutes in the frigid North Atlantic water before joining other survivors on a waterlogged collapsible boat and rowing through the night. Abelseth got married three years later, settled down as a farmer in North Dakota, had 4 kids, and died in 1980 at the age of 94.\n","\n","\n","### Conclusions\n","Initially I was disappointed by the accuracy of our machine learning models maxing out at about 80% for this data set. It’s easy to forget that these data points each represent real people, each of whom found themselves stuck on a sinking ship without enough lifeboats. When we looked into data points for which our model was wrong, we can uncover incredible stories of human nature driving people to defy their logical fate. It is important to never lose sight of the human element when analyzing this type of data set. This principle will be especially important going forward, as machine learning is increasingly applied to human data sets by organizations such as insurance companies, big banks, and law enforcement agencies.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"K4Vceh0OwtJX","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Take home questions\n","\n","(1) In performing our testing we have made some fundamental mistakes that results in overfitting to our 4 test cases.
